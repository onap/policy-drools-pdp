      "message": "Yep, apparently the RestManagerTest expects the UEB \u0026 DMAAP Factory classes to throw inconsistent exception types when an unknown topic is specified.  Could just fix it here, but maybe it\u0027s best to leave them inconsistent so-as not to break something else that may also depend on the inconsistency.  I pushed a review to restore the inconsistency in policy-common.",

      "message": "Not sure why the get(topicname) exception was changed from IllegalArgumentException to IllegalStateException in general in the policy/common review.   Was this one triggered by a sonar?  \n\nIn general, at this stage of the release, let\u0027s refreain to do interface changes, if avoidable, as they can manifest as bugs, downstream by library users obscured ways.   If possible interface changes should be done in the beginning of a release.\n\nIn another note, I question the policy/common review changes in this area, as the Factory.get(name) methods are used interactively with the rest apis, so an user can use it to probe for topics.   For those cases, an IllegalArgumentException seems more accurate than an IllegalStateException.",
