      "message": "In theory, I understand that liveness probes (in statefulset.yaml) and containers within a pod can communicate via localhost.  I have to test it out in a k8s environment to verify that this assumption is correct as I am not 100% sure.   I wanted to restrict accesss outside the pod that\u0027s the reason containing it to localhost.    I think it should have no side effects though, as nothing is pointing to it, but I may have to revisit it as you questioned if things don\u0027t work as I expect them once I try it out with the liveness probes.",
