The problem is that the supposed to be end-time is in UTC format, which is inconsistent with BeginTimestamp.\n\nThe comment is to keep both timestamps consistent.\n\nQuestion: What is the reason that the \"metricPattern\" is different than the transactionPattern?\n\nThe same question and comment would apply to the logback.xml in the feature-eelf project.",
