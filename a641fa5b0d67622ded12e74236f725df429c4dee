      "message": "Right, Ajith, it is mostly for reference, it could be used for manual installation but will expect folks to tweak it on a per lab basis.   Each installation has one of these files, there is one for OOM and one for CSIT.   In any case, the default for a minimum installation here I think it is OK as the policy-keystore/policy-truststore are provided in istanbul externally (either OOM - cert generator, or CSIT cert generator).   A minimal installation with no external certificate stores provided in the installation will not work if changing this default.",

      "message": "Not for the ones for the clients, this is just only for the servers that the drools opens.\nFor the clients is trickier since the remote server is in control of the protocol used, so AAI may be open for HTTP, and VFC for HTTPS only.\n\nNevertheless, I think what you are coming from the point of view that in some installations, components only use plain HTTP to talk to each other, and there is a sidecar or an ingress proxy that handles the https and the certs.   I think it will be a good addition, but we will need a new global flag to do it to be safe on configuration.   I could open a ticket for it, some flag like HTTP_CLIENT_HTTPS.   Sounds ok to you?",
