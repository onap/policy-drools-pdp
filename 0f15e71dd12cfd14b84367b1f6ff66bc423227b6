      "message": "The idea I had here is to keep it as a generic measurements class, where you can have a \"group\" start or global measurements, and then \"subgroup\" measurements where there are the details of the stats.   So, group and subgroups are used here in a more generic way, rather than the pdp groups and subgroups.   So the way that it will work is that on a PDP-D basis will have group stats with the totals, and subgroups of the form \"\u003ccontroller, policy\u003e\" pairs keeping the stats for those pairs.    I was thinking of arranging the subgroups on a per \"controller\" only basis, or \"policy\" only basis, but I thought the combination of both may be the more valuable to the user.   The When I finish the implementation, the group will map to the PdpStatistics top structure (PDP-D) and subgroups (\u003ccontroller,policy\u003e) will will map to the PdpEngineWorkerStatistics class of policy/models which is list contained by the PdpStatistics.",
