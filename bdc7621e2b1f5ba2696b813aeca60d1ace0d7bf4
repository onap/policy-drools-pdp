      "message": "this number should be \u003c than networkOut size, as the network.out populates all dmaap messages, and they are much more that the ones that would go through the embedded jetty servers.\n\nThis brings the question of the \"network.log\" should be used instead of \"access.log\" to log this kind of information.   I\u0027d like to hear your opinion on it.  Point being this is just additional network output, and very, very small in volume, and just for embedded jetty http servers\".\n\nOne alternative as well could be to have this log separated but with a more specific name, such http-server.log ..\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
