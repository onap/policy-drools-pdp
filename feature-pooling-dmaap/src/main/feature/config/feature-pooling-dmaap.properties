# In general, the feature-specific properties begin with "pooling",
# and they may be made specific to a controller by prepending with
# "pooling.<controller-name>", instead.
#
# The available properties and their default values are shown below.

# Whether or not the feature is enabled.
#pooling.enabled=false

# The internal DMaaP topic used by a controller.  Note: the controller
# name is required for this property.
#pooling.<controller-name>.topic =

# Maximum number of events to retain in the queue while a new host waits
# to be assigned work.
#pooling.offline.queue.limit=1000

# Maximum age, in milliseconds, of events to be retained in the queue.
# Events older than this are discarded. 
#pooling.offline.queue.age.milliseconds=60000

# Time, in milliseconds, to wait for an "Offline" message to be published
# to DMaaP before the connection may be closed.
#pooling.offline.publish.wait.milliseconds=3000

# Time, in milliseconds, to wait for this host's initial heart beat.  This
# is used to verify connectivity to the internal DMaaP topic.
#pooling.start.heartbeat.milliseconds=100000

# Time, in milliseconds, to wait before attempting to re-active this
# host when it was not assigned any work.
#pooling.reactivate.milliseconds=50000

# Time, in milliseconds, to wait for other hosts to identify themselves
# when this host is started.
#pooling.identification.milliseconds=50000

# Time, in milliseconds, to wait for heart beats from this host, or its
# predecessor, during the active state.
