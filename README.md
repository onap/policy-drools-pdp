This source repository contains the ONAP Policy DroolsPDP code. The settings file only needs to support the standard Maven repositories (e.g. central = http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/), and any proxy settings needed in your environment.

To build it using Maven 3, first build 'policy-common-modules' (which contains dependencies), and then run: mvn clean install
