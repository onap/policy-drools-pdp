Note that the apex-pdp has in its Dockerfile.  I think we should go through an exercise of reorganizing the images along the lines of the comment I made in https://jira.onap.org/browse/INT-995?focusedCommentId\u003d38448\u0026page\u003dcom.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-38448 in the beginning of a release.",
