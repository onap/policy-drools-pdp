      "message": "A fail here wouldn\u0027t be appropriate. By default, each Reports object contains a Report on the status of the PDP-D. Which in this junit is not alive because we don\u0027t need to test it. When we iterate onto the Report object for the PDP-D we just want to ignore it, not fail the junit.\n\nThis is what the Reports string looks like during the junit:\nReports [healthy\u003dfalse, details\u003d[\n  Report \n   [name\u003dPDP-D, url\u003dself, healthy\u003dfalse,\n    code\u003d500, message\u003dnot alive],\n  Report \n   [name\u003dHEALTHCHECK, \n    url\u003dhttp://localhost:7777/healthcheck/test,\n    healthy\u003dtrue, code\u003d200, message\u003dAll Alive]\n   ]\n  ]",
