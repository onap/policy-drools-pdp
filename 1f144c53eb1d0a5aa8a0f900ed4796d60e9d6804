      "message": "This method appears to be blocking the current thread, until the lock is obtained. If the lock is currently held by another transaction within this Drools session, it won\u0027t get a chance to run and free the lock, because this method is holding the one-and-only thread within the Drools session. As a result, this method will loop until the previous user times out, and forcibly take over the lock. Given that the \u0027sleep\u0027 is for 5 seconds, one loop would do it.",
