      "message": "jackson does still end up in the classpath, I think because of swagger.  Nonetheless, AFAIK, the RestServer in policy-common now defaults to gson instead of jackson and drools-pdp has been using that for at least a month.  I\u0027ve built to make sure the repos still build and junits run with these reviews, but it is still possible we\u0027ll find a limitation when running telemetry or CSITs - can revert if that\u0027s the case.",
