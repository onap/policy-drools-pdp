      "message": "I think it is better to remove lines 153-160.   I don\u0027t think it will add junit coverage, and it is junitted quite a bit in policy-endpoints.   My concern is because the sleep() interval may be sufficient in some cases, others not, depending on the jenkins server load, so may cause some junit failures once in a while.   Do you know if the jenkins failures you got before are related to this?   I can access older logs (have been deleted).",
