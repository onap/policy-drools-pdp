      "message": "mark as \"volatile\".\n\nI think this may give sonars since it is currently unchangeable, I think it will reflect the inconsistency and suggest to be marked as final. I am not very keen on changing code just to satisfy tests.\n\nIf doing this, better to add a setter to make it easier for all unit tests in the future regardless.   You can mark with lombok @NonNull in the setter method, as should protect against week references.   So the other comment is to add a setter protecting against null values.",
